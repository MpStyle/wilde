## About logo

**Font**: antre \
**Colors**: from left to right, #3D44FF and #6CB5FF.

## Libraries

Wilde uses:
- [React](https://react.dev/): for UI
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/): for app state
- [MUI](https://mui.com/): for UI component
- [vscode-icons](https://github.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons): for icons files

## Techniques:
- [Lazy loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading): used to load into the app state only the folders opened by the user.
- [Windowing](https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/virtual-lists/): used to render only the visible tree items in the DOM
